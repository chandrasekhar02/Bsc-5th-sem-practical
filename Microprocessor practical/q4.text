4. Write a program to load two unsigned numbers in register b & c. Subtract b from c. If the 
result is in 2â€™s complement, convert the result in absolute magnitude & display it

ans;-

        ORG 1000H  ; Assuming the program starts at address 1000H

; Load two unsigned numbers into registers B and C
MOV B, 30H  ; Example value for B
MOV C, 50H  ; Example value for C

; Subtract B from C
SUB B

; Check if the result is in 2's complement
JNC POSITIVE_RESULT  ; Jump if no carry (result is positive)

; Convert the result to absolute magnitude
CMA  ; Complement the accumulator (invert all bits)
INX D  ; Increment D register (to set the carry for the next addition)
ADD D  ; Add D to the complemented result to obtain absolute magnitude

POSITIVE_RESULT:
; The result (absolute magnitude) is now in the accumulator (A)

; Display the result (you need to replace this part with your actual display routine)
; For simplicity, assuming ASCII conversion for display
MOV A, E  ; Move the result to register E for display (you may adjust as needed)

HLT  ; Halt the program

END  ; End of the program
